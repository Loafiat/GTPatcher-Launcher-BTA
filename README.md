# FaQ
Q: Can you add mods, custom cosmetics, etc. in the base game? Give us App Lab!

A: We are NEVER, EVER changing anything about the game beyond just the servers it is linked to. No bullshit fake mods. Please promptly leave your suggestions in our trash can. Thank you!

Q: Can you do x beta?

A: Unfortunately, no :( - Another Axiom did some shit and now we can't download betas. Screwed up, isn't it?
