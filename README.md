 A launcher to download and patch particular versions of Gorilla Tag via a Steam account.

# FaQ
Q: Can you add mods, custom cosmetics, etc. in the base game? Give us App Lab!

A: We are NEVER, EVER changing anything about the game beyond just the servers it is linked to. No bullshit fake mods. Please promptly leave your suggestions in our trash can. Thank you!

Q: Can you do x beta?

A: Yeah! Betas are now possible because we were dumb dumb before

# Donations
We actively refuse any form of financial support, including donations.
